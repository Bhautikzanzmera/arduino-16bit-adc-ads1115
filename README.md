- Abstract **Accurate analog signal capture remains critical in embedded systems used for scientific analysis, healthcare instrumentation, and automated industrial processes. Although the Arduino DUE is well-known for its flexibility and accessibility, its internal 12-bit analog to digital converter (ADC) has several limitations. These include limited resolution, reliance on a constant voltage reference, and susceptibility to electrical interference, which might jeopardize precision in delicate measurements. To address these restrictions, a high-precision data-collecting setup was created by integrating the ADS1115, a 16-bit external ADC, over an IÂ²C communication interface. The system was built with modular hardware components, with a potentiometer acting as the analog signal source. Software was created using the Arduino IDE, with known libraries for device interfacing and data handling. A comparison was made between the Arduinoâ€™s internal ADC and the external ADS1115 under a variety of input situations. The investigation found that the ADS1115 consistently provided higher resolution, better signal stability, and lower noise sensitivity. These results highlight the ADS1115â€™s value as a dependable and cost-effective improvement for applications that require improved measurement accuracy in embedded contexts.**
